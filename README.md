# PCA on ESP32 Board
This project demonstrates how to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on an ESP32 board to reduce the dimensionality of data from 25 dimensions to 5 dimensions.

## Overview
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to simplify data while preserving its essential features. This project implements PCA on an ESP32 microcontroller, which is known for its compact size and capabilities.
